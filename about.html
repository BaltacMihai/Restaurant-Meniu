        <p class="about__text">
            Orotoro is the name of an ancient hunting tribe. A tribe from the time when people were hunter-gatherers. It
            was known among Homo sapiens and Neanderthals as the most skilled at hunting. So clever that they always had
            enough meat, which is why its members gave up picking fruits and vegetables.

            It is said that the Tortorians tamed the fire just to cook the meat, deciphering its mysteries so that it
            would get a crispy crust on the outside, but be juicy on the inside, complemented by the aroma of smoke.
            Some historians say that Prometheus himself, who brought the fire of the people, was also an Torotorian
            eager to make known the taste of meat cooked over a charcoal fire, and according to some anthropologists,
            "Toro-toro" meant in their language "Meat and only meat ‚Äù, hence their name.
